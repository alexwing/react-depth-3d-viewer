# react-depth-3d-viewer

Pseudo 3D photo viewer from a depth layer for React using pixi.js. 

In 3D computer graphics and computer vision, a depth map is an image or image channel that contains information relating to the distance of the surfaces of scene objects from a viewpoint. The depth map applied to a texture as a displacement filter can achieve a 3d effect, other implementations such as Facebook also allow interpolation of the non visible areas of the texture when moving in 3D.
